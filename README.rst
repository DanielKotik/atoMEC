AvAtom: python-based average-atom code for warm dense matter
========================
AvAtom is a python-based average-atom code for simulations of warm-dense matter. It uses Kohn--Sham density-functional theory, in combination with an average-atom approximation,
to solve the electronic structure problem for single-element materials at finite temperature.

More information on the average-atom methodology and Kohn--Sham density functional theory can be found (for example) in the following pre-print:
